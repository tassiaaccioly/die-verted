        The suspect starts laughing quietly and very rapidly it escalates into a
        maniacal laughter. He looks mad. You wait for him to stop laughing. He
        almost lose his breath and when you think there's no more air to breath,
        he looks at you. And before you can do anything he grabs you by your
        throat and you can see inside his eyes. He is so many people, so many
        things...

        You finally see yourself, standing on top of a mountain of bodies, it
        seems it was many many centuries ago, probably kiloyears. Somewhere
        inside you it comes back to you as a memory. You killed all those
        people, you and Kirlian. You had so much power. You had known the
        universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        As your mind fades into the thousands and thousands of past lives you
        lived, your body enters in shock, and beyond your body you can see
        yourself in a catatonic state, drooling from your mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can't move, you can't speak, you can only re-live the lives of
        nightmare you once lived, stuck in the thoughts of the atrocities you
        commited and losing yourself bit by bit until there's only darkness...
        Darkness, and the feeling of being nothing.
