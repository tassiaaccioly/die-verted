      <p class="game-text">The first night the dreams startedâ€¦</p>
      <p>
        You're in a room, and it suddenly starts filling with blood, but it's
        dark, almost black blood. It's viscous, the more you try to escape, the
        more it gets onto you. You drown in the blood and you can see the little
        girl's eyes in the darkness. Slowly the body starts forming around the
        eyes as they grow and grow, and transform into many different people.
        Below the eyes a severed tongue tries to articulate something, but you
        can't hear it. And suddenly it ends, with the feeling that there's
        something more in the darkness. Something preying on you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last two weeks alone with your thoughts and dreams were hell.
        Restless nights. Your mind now went to places you didn't want it to go.
        Places you specifically told it not to go. Bit by bit your sanity was
        slipping through your fingers.
      </p>
      <p>
        You try to hold on to every last bit of sanity you still have to walk
        into the precinct, but you look thin, beaten, and like you haven't slept
        since the event. In these two weeks you hear the suspect escaped the
        hospital and you feel like he could be at any corner you turn. Your life
        became unbearable. You just want to sleep. To sleep and never wake up
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your <span>void gun</span> was taken when you were issued a mandatory
        leave. But this is not a problem. You'd not be the first to plunge onto
        your death in this building. You step on the window, and looking at the
        <span>graphene</span> constructions all around, you feel relieved, and
        it's just another step.
