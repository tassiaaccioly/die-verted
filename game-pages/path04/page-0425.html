        Kirlian Krizik: This story is an old one, detective. When the stars were
        right and we could plunge from world to world through the sky, there was
        this being, made of darkness and despair. This being, which was
        nameless, was all powerful and could undermine any other outer gods in
        the sky. The gods made a pact of truce that lasted as long as this being
        was free. They knew they could not kill the inherit of evil, but they
        could imprison its mind.
