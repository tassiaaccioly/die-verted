        Kirlian Krizik: You don't understand right now but you will, detective.
        Only looking at the object can give you the wrong ideas. They were
        living in a confined space with the object for a few days before it
        really started to look ugly.
        <br /><br />
        They didn't even understand their own feelings. One of them started
        sabotaging the spaceship at every opportunity, soon after, another one
        joined and it became impossible for the other members to maintain the
        ship working, so in a matter of days we were drifting through the galaxy
        with no reactor, no navigational controls, and blood hungry crewmates.
        From this point on, chaos ensued. I just enjoyed the sight.
      </p>
      <p>
        You check the few notes you have on the case and the reactor not working
        checks out. Also other several places in the ship seem to be broken or
        not working as well, including the oxygen system. You feel the calling
        of the object. It seems stronger, you feel compelled to go look for it.
