      <p>
        You see the conveyor bringing the object. It's like nothing you've ever
        seen before, it seems like no light can touch it. It's a black mass with
        no reliefs, nothing written on it, nothing that indicates how it should
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        You touch it and it feels powerful. On your touch you can sense
        something vibrating. it starts slowly unravelling in your hand. It's not
        actually a box but you know what he means when he says that.
      </p>
      <p>
        The darkness inside the box is sticky, slimy. It crawls out and taints
        everything it touches, from people to objects, to graphene, to minds.
        Once opened you can't contain it. It spreads through the precinct
        rapidly and soon it's spreaded to the streets and space ports and people
        start screaming and losing their minds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some tear their eyes out, others rip each other apart, and as you,
        wielding all this power come outside the precinct you remember who you
        are. All powerful. You remember all the atrocities you committed in past
        lives, you remember being a god, and old god, ages and ages ago. Killing
        bugs was your favorite sport. You've been just waiting to awaken from
        the slumber.
      </p>
      <p>And it feels incredible.</p>
