        You burst into the interrogation room branding a holoscreen, you slide
        the video to the screen on the wall and there, huge, you can see his
        catatonic face. Now, seeing it this big you could almost swear he was
        smiling a little. He seemed almost happy. No. It was excitement. The
        video is getting clearer and clearer.
      </p>
      <p>
        You see the object on the floor, it has opened in some way and there you
        see just darkness, a hole so deep you can't see the bottom. The floor of
        the spaceship is filled with water that strangely seems to have a small
        tide. As the video progresses you can see the level of the water slowly
        rising. From the box you can see etched into the floor dark slimy foot
        prints whenever the man walks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The man in the image seems to be looking directly at you, and as you
        look at him you see him blink at you. In the middle of the intense fear
        you're feeling right now your turn around to see the man, just to find
        out he is no longer himself, he has transformed into an amorphous mass
        filled in eyes and fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        You hear screams from a thousand souls coming from inside your own head.
        In order to make it stop you press your ears with your hands until you
        fade out on the floor.
