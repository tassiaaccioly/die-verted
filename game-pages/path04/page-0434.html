        You get to the archive and you don't even need to punch any numbers, the
        machines inside the archive seem to know exactly what to do and bring
        you the object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before it reaches you, you can feel the power emanating from it. It
        vibrates, and it seems to synch with your body. You feel powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you finally touch it, it starts to melt away into pure liquid
        darkness. The liquid-like material spreads through the floor and enters
        your skin. You feel the entire universe and you remember being
        imprisoned for ages on end trying to call for humans to bring you your
        body. Humans were insignificant enough to pass unnoticed.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are finally back. The darkness that you are spreads over land and
        atmo, to the universe itself. And you can see all the chaos and
        destruction you're causing and cannot stop yourself from smiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        You now remember all the atrocities you committed in past lives, you
        remember being a god, and old god, ages and ages ago. Killing bugs was
        your favorite sport. You've been just waiting to awaken from the
        slumber.
      </p>
      <p>And it feels incredible.</p>
