        You make a signal to the cameras lodged in the walls asking for water.
        In the split second you take your attention elsewhere, the suspect found
        a way to cut himselves. The room and chair are filled with blood, you
        can't exactly pinpoint where he are hurt, and you try to secure the
        person who is flailing around on the floor painting everything in deep
        crimson red.
      </p>
      <p>
        Security and automated paramedics come pouring in the room and in a few
        minutes strap the person to a floating litter and take him off the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        You start spiraling into your thoughts and blame yourself for it, but
        you also can't stop feeling that there was something wrong with the
        person.
      </p>
      <p>
        You look at your bloody hands and try really hard to remember the order
        of events that led to this moment, but you can't quite remember. It
        feels like a dream. Like you've been in a deep sleep.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        You need to go to the precinct for the first time after the event.
        You've been home for two weeks on account of the dismissal the sergeant
        gave you and now you need to make a psychological evaluation to see if
        you're fit to come back.
