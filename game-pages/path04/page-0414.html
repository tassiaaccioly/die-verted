        Kirlian Krizik: You don't wanna know, detective. Just the thought of him
        can make a person go mad. You went mad once. It was in the beginning
        when you didn't fully understand what meant to be awakened. And then you
        chose to forget everything. Don't you feel it? Deep inside you? The will
        to be greater than these bugs around you? Don't you want to know real
        power?
      </p>
      <p>
        You have felt this desire before, the desire to be greater, but who
        hasn't? In a galaxy with trillions of individuals everyone wants to be
        special in some way.
