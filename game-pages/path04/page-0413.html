      <p>
        What are you talking about? We've never seen each other before. You
        killed your crew mates and then when the port security found your ship
        wandering around the quadrant you threw the first name that came to your
        head? You had plenty of time in that ship to erase all the security
        footage and search for my name, right? You tried to implicate me in your
        rampage and now you're just trying to make it look like we know each
        other.

            You just need to come back to reality. And the reality is: when you
            are convicted, because you will be, you'll prefer you had died on
            that ship. Start from the beginning, what were you doing on that
            ship in the first place?
