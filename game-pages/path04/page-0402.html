        The suspect doesn't say anything, he just looks up at you and you can
        finally see the eyes in person. He's terrifying. You feel like being
        dragged under. Hands grabbing your feet, your hands, your mouth, a dark
        slimy liquid slipping down your throat. You feel the air getting heavier
        and heavier and your lungs stop inflating and you're drowning in air.
        And you feel all of this in a split second before you blink. And then
        it's all gone. You're back in the interrogation room and the suspect is
        just sitting there looking at you quizzically.
      </p>
      <p>
        You definitely feel weirded out by the whole experience, but you need to
        continue your interactions. Where are you going to put your chair?

            The weird feeling of something still in your throat is unsettling,
            you don't want to get too close, also, you feel like you can get a
            better assessment of the suspect if you watch him from afar.
