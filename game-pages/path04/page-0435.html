        You exit the room and go straight to the police port where they're
        maintaining the ship. You ask to see the cargo, and the person says they
        never even removed the cargo from the ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        You enter the ship. The air seems heavy inside. The smell of death comes
        right into your nose. You walk to the hangar where the cargo is supposed
        to be. You can see a few enforced <span>graphene</span> boxes poorly lit
        by the few lights the police put in the ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        You come closer to one of the boxes and you can hear a low hum coming
        from them. You don't actually have the code for the boxes, but one of
        them seems to have been open.
      </p>
      <p>
        You walk to that one. You open the lid and a strong light comes into
        your eyes. It blinds you for a second and right after you can hear a
        purr. You look inside the box and there lies what seems an animal. Very
        fluffy, sleeping on top of a pillow. You get the little animal, it has a
        very fluffy tail that wiggles softly when you take it in your arms. It
        also vibrates a little, letting out a purr.
      </p>
      <p>You instantly feel happier. What's that? How can it make me happy?</p>
      <p>
        You just take it home with you and after a lot of digging and
        researching you uncover a video from the first 21st century that gives
        you an insight into what you have now:
