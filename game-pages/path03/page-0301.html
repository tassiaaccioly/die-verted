        You: So, you asked for me at the port. I've never seen you in my life.
        What was that about?

        Kirlian Krizik: This is a big confusion. I was not completely myself at
        that moment, and along with your name I also recited many other names.
        They must have assumed I was asking for you, detective, but it's just
        that a very dear friend of mine has the same name as you and I was
        thinking about them at that moment.

            This seems rather strange. You say you were incoherent saying names,
