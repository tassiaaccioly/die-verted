        You: So, start from the beginning, how did you end up on that ship?

        Kirlian Krizik: That ship is mine, and I was hired by ADACorp to make
        some cargo transportation from the borders of the Osu quadrant to the
        Main imperial quadrant. They seemed legit and were offering a hefty
        amount of credits for what seemed an easy job. I just had to find the
        right crew, they were offering extra credits for each member of the crew
        with military background.
