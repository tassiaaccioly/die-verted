        Kirlian Krizik: I've been searching for you for a long time, detective.
        Since we were separated and your mind took from you, actually. It took
        me centuries to find you in this shithole. They really didn't want
        anyone to find you.
        <br /><br />
        The worst part was finding that box, your mind. It has been calling for
        a long time. I'm sure you can feel it calling for you. That ship was
        just an easy way to get here, and to make you meet me. The people I
        killed on the way here were already dead the moment they decided to
        enter the ship with the box. You know what I'm talking about. You've
        known for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        You feel your toes tingling. The box is calling for you, vibrating more
        vigorously the more you wait.
      </p>
