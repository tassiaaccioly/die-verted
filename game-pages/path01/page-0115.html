        Kirlian Krizik: No, my mechatec said the ship seemed the same. Nothing
        accused on the scans and his physical investigation also didn't show any
        form of addendums to the ship.
        <br /><br />
        So we were very shocked when ROS-E5 started accusing malfunctions on the
        ship. Malfunctions we could verify were not really happening. The first
        big one was the comms, it had been sabotaged by someone. Commander
        Lovelace volunteered to manually fix the comms, and as she had seniority
        over all the crew, she was the one out there when the electrical
        discharge was released. She was the first to die, trying to fix our
        communications system.
