        Kirlian Krizik: They were looking for someone to assemble a crew to
        transport some cargo from the border of the <span>Osu quadrant</span> to
        the <span>Main Imperial Quadrant</span>. The ad asked for a dragonfly
        class ship and if the crew had military background they would pay extra
        credits. Me being a veteran pilot from the
        <span>Ak'rabahr war</span> had several friends who were in need of come
        credits. I called some of them and assembled the crew. <br /><br />
        When I contacted them to say I had the crew, the
        <span>ADACorp's</span> person said I'd have to let my ship with them for
        a week prior to the transport. They needed to check my ship for security
        breaches and malfunctions. The cargo was too important and needed to be
        secure.
