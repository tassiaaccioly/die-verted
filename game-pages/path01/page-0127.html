        Kirlian Krizik: It was all "fine" for a while when we began the trip.
        The first thing that seemed wrong was, one day I woke up and when I went
        to do my routine tasks at security to see if everything was ok during
        the night. Getting there, all the videos were down. All logs had been
        erased. So, when this happened we called an emergency meeting. Everybody
        started accusing each other, they all had seen one of the others acting
        suspicious at some point. It was madness. Nothing was made on this first
        meeting because we couldn't decide what had happened, so we just decided
        to fix whatever had happened to the logs and went on.
