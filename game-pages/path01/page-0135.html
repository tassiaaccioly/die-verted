        Kirlian Krizik: After most of the crew has already died, we finally
        realised what was happening: ROS-E5 was malfunctioning and causing
        situations to kill the crewmembers, it already had shot Carrie-Anne Moss
        into space, killed Sarah Connor while she was in her sleeping chamber,
        and decapitated Ripley with a conveyour door. <br /><br />

        So we had another emergency meeting, this time to decide who would
        disconnect ROS-E5. We knew that disconnecting it would mean destroying
        the ship and leaving the ship drifting through the sky. Also it would
        mean only one of us would survive since there would be no oxygen for
        everybody. Disconnecting ROS-E5 meant only one of us would survive,
        which was better than none of us surviving.

        <br /><br />
        I was not actually the one who got the straw, but my dear friend<span
          id="playerName"
        >
          your name here</span
        >. Yes, detective, my friend who saved me had the same name as you. They
        gave their life so that I could be here now, telling all their stories,
        unfortunately.
