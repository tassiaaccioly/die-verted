        Kirlian Krizik: I don't really know. Maybe if you investigate the ship
        you can find out what they were trying to do.
      </p>
      <p>You open your Comm and access the case files:</p>

      <p class="idfile">-- Case file 1438-KK --</p>

      <p>
        You read through a few lines and rapidly you see that there was no
        physical evidence about the ship. The broken mainframe stopped them from
        reaching any video and or audio from the ship, so if there were any
        videos they would not be able to access, also, in the mechatec scans
        report there aren't any mentions of anything wrong with the systems,
        from what they could uncover. But again, the mainframe was compromised
        so they can't say for sure.
