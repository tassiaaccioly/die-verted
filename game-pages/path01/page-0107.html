        Kirlian Krizik: We were contracted to transport some cargo, it seemed
        innocent enough, but they requested my ship to stay at their facility
        for a week to pass through some routine check ups to see if everything
        was ok for the trip. They paid very well and I was in need of credits,
        so I believed it wasn't a problem to leave the ship there for a week.
        Later I could have my own <span>mechatec</span> look at it to see if any
        drastic changes had been made.
