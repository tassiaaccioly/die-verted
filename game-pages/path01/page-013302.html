      <h2>I believe Kirlian Krizik is guilty</h2>
      <p>
        You've heard his story and all of that seems too perfectly constructed
        to be true. He had plenty of time on that ship to craft these excuses no
        one can verify for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, you feel in your gut this guy is guilty, you felt from the very
        first time you've seen him, so you've been taking all his story with a
        big grain of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some officers enter the room to take him away. You feel proud of another
        good work. He will be sent to the asteroid prison with a sentence for
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the memorial for the families who lost their loved ones in the ship,
        you share personal belongings of the deceased personnel and console some
        people saying that the perpetrator is gonna rot in the asteroid prison
        if it depends on you.
      </p>
