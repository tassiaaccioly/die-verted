        Kirlian Krizik: At the time we didn't know, It seemed just like a
        malfunction. Our flight engineer checked everything and all seemed ok,
        no problems at all.
        <br /><br />
        As things started unfolding we as a group realized someone or ROS-E5 had
        something to do with it, and after other crewmates being incinerated,
        shot into space and decapitated with a conveyor door, we all agreed that
        we were facing the AI.
        <br /><br />
        We were hostages of a mad AI, who was killing us one by one. We had to
        make a choice: one of us would have to break the mainframe of the ship
        to remove ROS-E5 but it would mean all of the others would have to give
        their lives so this person could possibly survive with what was left of
        oxygen on the ship or we would all die to a power hungry AI. We chose
        the first option.
        <br /><br />
        We pulled straws and I was not the one with the lucky straw, but my best
        friend, ${playerName} gave me their straw so I can be saved and tell you
        this story today and honor all the crewmates names.
