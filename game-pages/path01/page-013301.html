      <h2>I believe Kirlian Krizik is innocent</h2>
      <p>
        You've heard his story. And mostly because you don't have enough
        physical evidence and on the account of him sounding believable you
        declare Kirlian Krizik innocent from the accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many months later the ship is analysed by specialized personnel from the
        real ADACorp and they manage to reassemble the mainframe but can't prove
        if Kirlian was innocent or not. You'll have to trust your gut this time
        detective.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mainframe of the ship was taken into custody to be studied and
        Kirlian was given a brand new ROS-E6.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have a feeling the ADACorp people are not being completely honest
        about the ship, but you don't have the power to ask for it.
        Investigating this shady company will have to happen another day.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end Kirlian was really grateful to you for believing in his
        story, but since declaring him innocent you've never seen him again.
      </p>

      <h2>Congratulations detective, another case solved!</h2>
