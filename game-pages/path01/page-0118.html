        Kirlian Krizik: We were receiving warnings of errors and malfunctions
        more frequently every passing day. ROS-E5 was accusing errors that
        didn't exist. At one point it was really hard to know what was truly an
        error, what was a possible human sabotage and what was an AI sabotage.
        People were accusing each other of sabotaging electrical, or sabotaging
        the doors. It was insanity. And we couldn't really move the ship because
        ROS-E5 wouldn't power the engines.
        <br /><br />
        My guess is: the person saying they were from ADACorp wanted to see how
        people would react? I don't really know, you should search the ship for
        evidence. It must exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        You read through a few lines and rapidly you see that there was no
        physical evidence about the ship. The broken mainframe stopped them from
        reaching any video and or audio from the ship, so if there were any
        videos they would not be able to access them, also, in the
        <span>mechatec scans</span> report there aren't any mentions of anything
        wrong with the systems, from what they could uncover. But again, the
        mainframe was compromised so they can't say for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        You: You compromised the mainframe of the ship. Unfortunately we have no
        way of confirming what you just told us.
