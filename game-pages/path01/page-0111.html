        Kirlian Krizik: I had to kill the ship. There was something wrong with
        ROS-E5. It kept accusing errors and malfunctions. Everybody started
        accusing each other for the malfunctions and everyone grew suspicious of
        each other, but at one time we realised it was the computer.
        <span>ROS-E5</span> was accusing malfunctions and errors that
        specifically seemed like things someone could be doing. It has a low
        chance of malfunction but it could only be it. So our only option was to
        kill the navigational computer. <br /><br />
        But for that we would have to disconnect the whole ship and we would not
        have enough air for everybody to survive the whole way without engines.
        We picked straws and my friend <span class="playerName"></span> was the
        one to get the surviving straw.
