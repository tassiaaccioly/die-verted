        Kirlian Krizik: We actually tried it but <span>ROS-E5</span> was
        accusing physical malfunction on the antenna and couldn't connect to it,
        so we had to fix it on site. The logs apparently could have something to
        do with the antennas, so we decided to fix the whole thing. <br /><br />
        The case is, there was nothing physically wrong with the antennas, and
        <span>commander Lovelace</span> died for nothing. When retrieving her
        body the flight engineer was able to do a scan and the antennas were
        fine. But we still didn't have <span>Comms</span> or security video on
        the ship. <br /><br />
        Before this though ROS-E5 was already turning lights on and off, closing
        doors on the way, and doing some other little things.

            This seems very odd. There are literally no other reports of ROS-E5
            malfunctioning in any recent tests. What do you think happened?
