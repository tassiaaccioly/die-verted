        Kirlian Krizik: The main problem of the ship were the malfunctions, but
        the malfunctions lead to unfinished tasks and some very big suspicions
        amongst the crewmates. Some of them believed we had an impostor among
        us. That some guy was sabotaging the ship. They refused to believe the
        problem was on the AI logic, so the team turned on each other, which
        created a very stressful and problematic environment for us, so when
        times came to choose someone to go solve some malfunction, people would
        vote for who was the one to go test the AI allegiance next. This way we
        lost some of the crew in a few days.
        <br /><br />
        At last in the last day half of the crew was still alive we reached a
        consensus that we had to kill ROS-E5. The AI system was controlling all
        the aspects of the ship, so we couldn't just turn it off, we would have
        to disconnect it from the whole ship, and the easiest way to do that was
        to damage the mainframe.
        <br /><br />
        The crew took straws and I was the one lucky enough to stay on the ship
        since drifting through space without many reserves of oxygen would only
        be possible for one person. The rest of the crew wanted me to get here.
        To tell you this story, detective. May this serve as a cautionary tale.
