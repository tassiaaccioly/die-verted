        Kirlian Krizik: Half of the crew believed the other half had something
        to do with the faulty logs. There was a tense atmosphere on the ship for
        a few days, but each time more and more ROS-E5 started accusing errors
        and malfunctions. We didn't want to believe the AI was faulty, but came
        a time where this was obvious. There was no denying, we had fallen into
        the 2000 to 1 chance of ROS-E5 being faulty.
        <br /><br />
        We made another emergency meeting, this time to discuss the possibility
        of disabling the navigational AI. Unfortunately at this point commander
        Lovelace had already left us on an accident fixing one of the external
        antennas that were accusing errors and disabling our Comm system, so it
        was hard to get to a conclusion.
