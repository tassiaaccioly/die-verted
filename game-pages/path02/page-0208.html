        You dream. A dark dream. You feel stuck into something… something…
        gooey. You crawl on the ground, and you feel surrounded by nothingness,
        by the vastitude of the space. You remember of a time before time, when
        men and stars were one and you were filled with emptiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something. Something crawling in the dark. Something behind you, it can
        almost touch you. Creepy eyes that follow you around. You feel alone and
        observed. You feel like you'll never be happy again. There's no escape.
        there's no escaping the...
      </p>
      <p>CONNECTING… CONNECTING… CONNECTING</p>
      <p>
        From your slumber you take ages to understand the Comm is trying to
        connect with you. You wake up and check the Comm. It has 21 missed
        connections. All from your mother. You call them:
      </p>
      <p>
        They sound like they've been crying and seem relieved when they hear
        you. They want to know if you're ok. They say something about a weird
        event and seeing rocks and dirt. You can't quite understand them, but
        they say you should turn on the television. You turn it on and you can
        see the enormous crater that now lies where the police precinct should
        be. About one kilometer in diameter, everything vanished with it. You
        can see rocks and dirt in the crater. Something you've never seen in
        your life, and suddenly you realize:
      </p>
      <p>There's no more precinct. No more work. No more case. No more game.</p>
