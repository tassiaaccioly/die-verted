        You dream of actually going to watch "Trial by Combat Lawyer" live. It
        has always been a dream of you, and it's like you've always imagined.
        The stadium is packed with people from all places, the blinding lights
        pointing to the huge ring style courtroom in the middle of the stadium
        where the lawyers battle for his clients. One of the last earthly
        entertainment that survived the surge of the empire.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crowd goes insane cheering for his favourites and you can't stop
        yourself from screaming alongside them. And then you see it. Your
        favourite lawyer, Sanction Fists, entering the courtroom. She's huge.
        Her interns, dressed in old timing, suits running after her, catching
        all the process' chips people throw her way. She's magnificent. She
        enters the ring like she owns the place…
      </p>
      <p>CONNECTING… CONNECTING… CONNECTING</p>
      <p>
        From your slumber you take ages to understand the Comm is trying to
        connect with you. You wake up and check the Comm. It has 21 missed
        connections. All from your mother. You call them:
      </p>
      <p>
        They sound like they've been crying and seem relieved when they hear
        you. They want to know if you're ok. They say something about a weird
        event and seeing rocks and dirt. You can't quite understand them, but
        they say you should turn on the television. You turn it on and you can
        see the enormous crater that now lies where the police precinct should
        be. About one kilometer in diameter, everything has vanished with it.
        You can see rocks and dirt in the crater. Something you've never seen in
        your life, and suddenly you realize:
      </p>
      <p>There's no more precinct. No more work. No more case. No more game.</p>
