        You wake up and it seems like the extra five minutes didn't do any good
        for your life. You wonder to yourself how can five minutes make any
        difference? You feel like crap, maybe if you slept more you would be
        rested, but you don't have time for that anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        You change clothes fast and get out of the apartment. You know that
        extra five minutes will translate in you getting to work right on time.
        Security at your building's gate is doing a scheduled routine search
        with everyone entering or leaving the premises. You remember now seeing
        the notice that had been showing on your apartment console and regret
        not waking up 5 minutes earlier. This will probably make you later than
        you expected. You will probably need to work another late shift to cover
        for the lateness. You enter the line to get some breakfast rations at
        some shady half door, commissary style, where a weirdly not tattoed
        genderless human without any hair on his body delivers ration chips
        against his will.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you wait in the long line, you receive a connection. It's your
        father, they want to know if you're ok. They say something about a weird
        event and seeing rocks and dirt. You can't quite understand them, but
        you don't really need to as the screen above the commissary starts
        blinking in red with urgent news.
      </p>
      <p>
        The screen shows a high view footage from the place where the police
        precinct was and that now shows a very large hole in the ground with
        about a kilometer diameter. Some authorities and policepeople surround
        the place the camera is showing. Now you understand what your mother was
        saying about rocks and dirt. The hole is very deep and has crossed the
        titanium cover on the earth, and for the first time in your life you can
        see dirt and rocks in it. And you finally realize:
      </p>
      <p>There's no more precinct. No more work. No more case. No more game.</p>
