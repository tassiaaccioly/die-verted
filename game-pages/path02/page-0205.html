        You wake up well rested. In your fridge you find some fast regenerative
        rations (famously known as <span>regenex</span>) that taste like
        strawberries. You mentally thank your friend Marcus for insisting on you
        taking the regenexes at the end of his party and make a mental note to
        take some time this week to buy some rations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strawberry regenex isn't your favorite but it's all you have right
        now, so you slurp one and take another one for the road. You walk out
        the door and pass through the building security that ensures you're a
        tenant. You live in a government issued apartment, so security is always
        there. As you come to the elevator that will take you to the shuttle
        station you receive a connection. It's Rita, your partner from the
        police station. They say the police station just vanished along with all
        things in a kilometer diameter.
      </p>
      <p>
        You turn and on the screen behind you you can see the crater in the
        ground where the precinct used to be. Several
        <span>policepeople, firepeople</span> and other authorities are on site.
        You can see rocks and dust in the hole, something you've never seen in
        your life.
      </p>
      <p>There's no more precinct. No more work. No more case. No more game.</p>
