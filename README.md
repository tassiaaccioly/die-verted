**This game is on beta release.**

_You're a seasoned investigator with the intergalactic police. You've been working non-stop for the last three days, and now, as you're right about to leave the precinct, you find another case chip folder named 1438-KK on your work station. You don't know much about what happened but you're tasked with questioning the suspect. You feel tired, hungry and dirty, an interrogation was the last thing you needed right now._

Die Verted is a narrative game with multiple endings where the player is a detective trying to solve a crime.

On each page the player is given a context of what is happening and two or three options to chose from. This leads the player to another page with the same dynamics.
