    <p>
      This is a narrative story with multiple endings where you are a detective
      trying to solve a space murder.
    </p>

    <p>
      On each page you'll be given a context of what is happening and two or
      three options to chose. This will lead you to another page with the same
      dynamics.
    </p>

    <p>Your objective is to get to the final. Any of them.</p>

    <h2>Attention!</h2>

    <p>
      This game doesn't save! Once you close the window your progress is gone
      forever.
